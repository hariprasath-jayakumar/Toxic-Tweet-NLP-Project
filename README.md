# Toxic-Tweet-NLP-Project

## Introduction

This project aims to build a predictive model to identify toxic or harmful content in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset contains labeled tweets where 'Toxic' tweets are labeled as 1 and 'Non-toxic' tweets are labeled as 0.
## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle. The credits for collecting the original dataset go to the respective contributors.
## Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

scikit-learn
## Procedure
1) Download the dataset from Kaggle.

2) Extract the contents of the downloaded file.

3) Install the required libraries.
## Steps 

## Data Preprocessing

1) Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

2) Handle missing values (if any).

3) Clean and preprocess the text data (e.g., removing special characters, lowercasing, tokenizing, etc.).

## Feature Representation

1) Convert the text data into Bag of Words (BoW) representation using CountVectorizer.

2) Convert the text data into TF-IDF representation using TfidfVectorizer.

## Model Training and Evaluation
1 Split the data into training and testing sets.

2 Train the following classification models on both BoW and TF-IDF representations:

    • Decision Trees
    • Random Forest
    • Naive Bayes
    • K-NN Classifier
    • SVM Classifier
## Metrics Calculation

For each model, calculate the following metrics on the test set:

    • Precision
    • Recall
    • F1-Score
    • Confusion Matrix
    • ROC-AUC Curv
## Results

The trained models' performance metrics will be displayed in the console or notebook output, allowing you to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in identifying toxic tweets.
## Further Improvements

• Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.

• Consider using data augmentation or oversampling techniques to address class imbalance if present.
